## How to run project
First clone into the repository:
```shell 
git clone https://github.com/amirhnajafiz/Online-Shop.git
```

Then go into the root directory of the project:
```shell 
cd digikala-sample
```

Now reload the composer:
```shell
composer dump
```

Now create the database and set <b>.env</b> file based on your information and system.<br />
Now run the database migrations:
```shell
php artisan migrate --seed --step
```

Ok now we need to set up the font-end:
```shell
npm i & npm run dev
```

After that enter the following command to start the server:
```shell
php artisan serve
```

If you get something like this, then you are good to go:
```shell
Starting Laravel development server: http://127.0.0.1:8000
